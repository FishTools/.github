## fishtools Security Policy

The fishtools organization takes security seriously. We are committed to creating a responsible environment for developers and users of our MQL tools and libraries. This document outlines our approach to security vulnerabilities and how you can report them.

### Supported Versions

We strive to maintain the security of our projects. However, due to the ever-evolving nature of security threats, we can only guarantee support and provide security patches for the following versions:

* Clearly state the versions (e.g., latest major version, X.Y.z or specific version range) of your projects that you actively maintain and will address security vulnerabilities in.

**Example:**

* We will address security vulnerabilities reported in the **latest major version (X.Y.z)** of our projects. 
* We may offer limited support or security patches for older versions on a case-by-case basis. 

**Please note:** You should always update your projects to the latest supported version to benefit from the most recent security fixes.


### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a potential security vulnerability in a fishtools project, we encourage you to report it responsibly. Here's how:

* **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly:** Public disclosure of vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actors before they are addressed.
* **Contact the fishtools security team directly:** We have a dedicated channel for receiving security vulnerability reports. Please send an email to [email address removed].
* **Provide detailed information:**  In your report, please include the following information:
    * A clear description of the vulnerability
    * Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (if possible)
    * The version of the project affected
    * Any additional information that might help us understand and address the vulnerability

We will acknowledge your report within 24 hours and work diligently to fix the vulnerability in a timely manner. We will keep you informed of the progress and notify you once a fix is released.

### We appreciate your cooperation!

By working together, we can ensure the security of our MQL tools and libraries for everyone. If you have any questions about this security policy, please feel free to contact the fishtools security team at [email address removed].
